## Todos:
* check if my current implementation works as expected on a very small case
* experiment with using a hashmap -> string 2 states together to get their Q, R values?
* get generating random state + all next valid states given a particular state
* handling the situation where a state is reached that has not been explored yet?
	-> what is the probability that a given state has not been explored given the total # of states & the # of episodes?
